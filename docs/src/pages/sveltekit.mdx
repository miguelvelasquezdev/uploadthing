# Getting Started with SvelteKit

Make sure you
[install the packages and get your env variables first](/getting-started)

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](/create-account) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="src/lib/server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/sveltekit";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/sveltekit";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(() => ({}))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => {
      console.log("upload completed", data);
    }),

  withMdwr: f({
    image: {
      maxFileCount: 2,
      maxFileSize: "1MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware((opts) => {
      const h = opts.req.headers.get("someProperty");

      if (!h) throw new Error("someProperty is required");

      return {
        someProperty: h,
        otherProperty: "hello" as const,
      };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ metadata, file }) => {
      console.log("uploaded with the following metadata:", metadata);
      console.log("files successfully uploaded:", file);
    }),

  withoutMdwr: f({
    image: {
      maxFileCount: 2,
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(() => {
      return { testMetadata: "lol" };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ metadata, file }) => {
      console.log("uploaded with the following metadata:", metadata);
      console.log("files successfully uploaded:", file);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create a handle hook using the FileRouter

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This exposes the API route `/api/uploadthing`. Make sure not to create
  an endpoint with the same path.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/hooks.server.ts"
import type { Handle } from "@sveltejs/kit";
import {
  PORT,
  UPLOADTHING_APP_ID,
  UPLOADTHING_SECRET,
} from "$env/static/private";
import { uploadRouter } from "$lib/server/uploadthing";

import { createUploadthingHandle } from "uploadthing/sveltekit";

export const handle: Handle = createUploadthingHandle({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: {
    callbackUrl: `http://localhost:${PORT ?? 5173}/api/uploadthing`,
    uploadthingSecret: UPLOADTHING_SECRET,
    uploadthingId: UPLOADTHING_APP_ID,
  },
});
```

If you need multiple handle hooks in your application take a look at the
[sequence](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-hooks-sequence)
helper function from SvelteKit.

### Creating The UploadThing Components (optional)

Generating components let's you pass your generic `FileRouter` once and then
have typesafe components everywhere, instead of having to pass the generic
everytime you mount a component, but you can also import the components
individually from `@uploadthing/svelte`.

```ts copy filename="src/lib/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateComponents } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "../server/uploadthing";

export const { UploadButton, UploadDropzone, Uploader } =
  generateComponents<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

The `@uploadthing/svelte` package includes an "Uploader" component that you can
simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately. To create the
"Uploader" props you can use the "createUploader" helper. Make sure to pass your
generic `FileRouter` to this function.

```svelte copy filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import type { OurFileRouter } from "$lib/server/uploadthing";

  import { createUploader, Uploader } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

  const uploader = createUploader<OurFileRouter>({
    endpoint: "withoutMdwr",
    onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
      console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
    onUploadError: (error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    },
  });
</script>

<main
  class="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center gap-16 p-24"
>
  <Uploader {uploader} />
</main>
```

You can also choose to use the "UploadButton" and "UploadDropzone" components
separately. Both are included in the `@uploadthing/svelte` package.

```svelte copy filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import type { OurFileRouter } from "$lib/server/uploadthing";

  import { createUploader, Uploader } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

  const uploader = createUploader<OurFileRouter>({
    endpoint: "withoutMdwr",
    onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
      console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
    onUploadError: (error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    },
  });
</script>

<div class="ut-flex ut-flex-col ut-items-center ut-justify-center ut-gap-4">
  <span class="ut-text-center ut-text-4xl ut-font-bold">
    {`Upload a file using a button:`}
  </span>
  <UploadButton {uploader} />
</div>
<div class="ut-flex ut-flex-col ut-items-center ut-justify-center ut-gap-4">
  <span class="ut-text-center ut-text-4xl ut-font-bold">
    {`...or using a dropzone:`}
  </span>
  <UploadDropzone {uploader} />
</div>
```

</Steps>
